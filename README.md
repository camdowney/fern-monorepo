# Fern Monorepo
This is a monorepo that contains the code for the npm packages fernui-react, fernutil-react, fernutil, and fernicons. 

Currently, this repo operates on NextJS to develop all packages in tandem. If support for other libraries beyond React is added in the future, the repo will be modularized accordingly.

Documentation coming soon.
